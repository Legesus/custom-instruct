# Pentester Research

This skill helps you research penetration testing topics, vulnerability mechanics, and exploitation techniques using high-quality, trusted industry resources.

## Overview
Use this skill to research security concepts. It focuses on **educational** and **defensive** understanding, providing clear explanations, examples, and remediation strategies.

## Trusted Resources
Prioritize information from these domains:
- **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** (`portswigger.net`)
- **OWASP** (`owasp.org`)
- **HackTricks** (`book.hacktricks.xyz`)
- **PayloadAllTheThings** (`github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings`)
- **GTFOBins** (`gtfobins.github.io`)
- **Rapid7 Database** (`rapid7.com/db`)
- **MITRE ATT&CK / CWE** (`mitre.org`)

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze the Request
Determine the specific vulnerability, tool, or concept the user is asking about.
*Example: "How do I exploit prototype pollution?" -> Topic: Prototype Pollution*

### Step 2: Perform Targeted Research
Use the `search_web` tool finding the best reputable sources.
*Query examples:*
- `site:portswigger.net prototype pollution`
- `site:book.hacktricks.xyz visual studio code rce`

### Step 3: Synthesize Findings
Present the information in the following structured format:

#### 1. Concept/Vulnerability Name
A brief, high-level explanation of what it is.

#### 2. Technical Mechanics (How it works)
Explain the underlying issue (e.g., "The application merges user input recursively into the base object prototype...").

#### 3. Common Vectors / Payloads
Provide representative examples or payloads.
```javascript
// Example Payload
{
  "__proto__": {
    "isAdmin": true
  }
}
```

#### 4. Detection & Exploitation
How to identify if an application is vulnerable and how to verify it (theoretical/PoC).

#### 5. Remediation
How developers should fix the issue.

## Examples

### Example 1: Researching SQL Injection
User: "Explain Union-Based SQL Injection."
Action: Search `site:portswigger.net union based sql injection`.
Output: detailed explanation using the structure above.

### Example 2: Finding specialized payloads
User: "I need lists of XSS payloads for filter bypass."
Action: Search `site:github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings XSS filter bypass`.

## Notes
- **Safety First**: Always remind the user to only test systems they have explicit permission to test.
- **Context Awareness**: If the user is asking about a specific stack (e.g., "SQLi in PostgreSQL"), refine the search to include that technology.
- **No Attacking**: This skill is for *research*. Do not use it to launch actual attacks against live targets.
